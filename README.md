BugByte 2020
Developer: Ziyan Prasla

This web application is intended to help developers collaborate and record all tasks/issues within their software development projects. 
Intended to create a simple UI compared to Github and other such applications.


CURRENT PROGRESS: 

The foundational UX has been designed. The ticket and project system has all been built using HTML(Bootstrap)/CSS. A Bootstrap template has been 
placed on top of the project to minimize time spent on CSS (centering and positioning). 

PHP and MYSQL is being used to record all projects and tickets for those projects on the backend. As of 3/28/2020, the projects tab has full functionality.
The tickets tab needs some restructuring due to unexpected challenges with the form reacting to changes in the database. 



TO-DO:
1. Complete Tickets functionality

2. Add support for multiple users, Authorization and Authentication will be implemented. Planning on using a 3rd party such as Auth0 to
 handle the security.

3. Top bar will be customized for individual users

4. Implement some type of collaborator tabs so not all users of the app are shown when choosing developers for certain projects.
